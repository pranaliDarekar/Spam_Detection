The integration of Firefly optimization, advanced spam detection, and predictive modeling has yielded a remarkable 90% accuracy in spam email detection and filtration. Furthermore, the system's regression capabilities have provided highly precise forecasts with a minimal 5% generalized error. This achievement is primarily attributed to the tokenization process that eliminates buzzwords and irrelevant content, enabling a more focused analysis. Beyond mere spam identification, this approach delves into sender identification and intent analysis, making it a powerful tool for enhancing email security. This innovative solution has significantly improved communication system efficiency and resilience against spam and cyber threats.
